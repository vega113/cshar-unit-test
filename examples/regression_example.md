# Regression
Let's consider an example of a simple StringOperations class that has a Concatenate method that concatenates two strings. We'll create a unit test for this method, and then modify the functionality while relying on the test to verify that the code still works.
- Initial StringOperations class:
```csharp
public class StringOperations
{
    public string Concatenate(string a, string b)
    {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```
- MSTest unit test for the Concatenate method:
```csharp
using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting;
using YourProjectNamespace;

[TestClass]
public class StringOperationsTests
{
    [TestMethod]
    public void Concatenate_ShouldReturnConcatenatedStrings_WhenGivenTwoStrings()
    {
        // Arrange
        var stringOperations = new StringOperations();
        string a = "Hello";
        string b = "World";
        string expectedResult = "HelloWorld";

        // Act
        string result = stringOperations.Concatenate(a, b);

        // Assert
        Assert.AreEqual(expectedResult, result);
    }
} 
```

- Now, we want to modify the Concatenate method to allow an optional separator between the two strings.
```csharp
public class StringOperations
{
    public string Concatenate(string a, string b, string separator = "")
    {
        return a + separator + b;
    }
} 
```

- Update the existing test and add a new test to cover the new functionality:

```csharp
using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting;
using YourProjectNamespace;

[TestClass]
public class StringOperationsTests
{
    [TestMethod]
    public void Concatenate_ShouldReturnConcatenatedStrings_WhenGivenTwoStringsAndNoSeparator()
    {
    // Arrange
    var stringOperations = new StringOperations();
    string a = "Hello";
    string b = "World";
    string expectedResult = "HelloWorld";
    // Act
    string result = stringOperations.Concatenate(a, b);

    // Assert
    Assert.AreEqual(expectedResult, result);
    }

    [TestMethod]
    public void Concatenate_ShouldReturnConcatenatedStringsWithSeparator_WhenGivenTwoStringsAndSeparator()
    {
        // Arrange
        var stringOperations = new StringOperations();
        string a = "Hello";
        string b = "World";
        string separator = "-";
        string expectedResult = "Hello-World";
    
        // Act
        string result = stringOperations.Concatenate(a, b, separator);
    
        // Assert
        Assert.AreEqual(expectedResult, result);
    }
}
```
Now, after modifying the `Concatenate` method to support an optional separator, we have updated the existing test to cover the case when no separator is provided and added a new test to cover the case when a separator is provided. These tests will help us ensure that our changes haven't broken existing functionality and the new feature works as expected.

By maintaining a comprehensive suite of unit tests, we can catch regressions, ensure the correctness of our codebase, and minimize the risk of introducing bugs when adding or modifying features. As we continue to develop our application, it's crucial to keep the following best practices in mind:

**Write tests for new functionality**: As you develop new features or modify existing ones, always write corresponding unit tests to cover the changes. This ensures that the new code works as expected and doesn't introduce any regressions.

**Keep tests focused and isolated**: A unit test should cover a single functionality or scenario. If a test is too broad, it becomes harder to pinpoint the source of a failure when it occurs.

**Keep test code clean and maintainable**: Just like your production code, your test code should be clean, well-organized, and easy to understand. This makes it easier for other team members to read, understand, and update your tests as needed.

**Run tests frequently**: Make sure to run the full suite of unit tests regularly, especially before merging any changes into the main branch. This helps catch issues early and ensures that the codebase remains stable and reliable.

**Implement continuous integration**: If possible, set up continuous integration (CI) to automatically run your unit tests whenever changes are pushed to the repository. This helps maintain a high-quality codebase and provides instant feedback on the impact of new code.



By following these best practices and maintaining a robust suite of unit tests, you'll be well-equipped to develop a reliable and maintainable application. Remember that unit testing is an essential part of a healthy software development process, and investing time and effort into writing and maintaining tests will pay off in the long run.
