Unit testing provides confidence that your new code doesn't break existing functionality because it ensures that each unit of code works as expected, even after changes or additions have been made. Here's a C# example that demonstrates this:

Let's say we have a simple `Calculator` class:

```csharp
public class Calculator
{
    public int Add(int a, int b)
    {
        return a + b;
    }

    public int Multiply(int a, int b)
    {
        return a * b;
    }
}
```
Now, we create a unit test for the Add and Multiply methods using a testing framework like Xunit:

```
using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting;
using YourProjectNamespace;

[TestClass]
public class CalculatorTests
{
    [TestMethod]
    public void Add_ShouldReturnCorrectSum_WhenGivenTwoIntegers()
    {
        // Arrange
        var calculator = new Calculator();
        int a = 3, b = 5;

        // Act
        int result = calculator.Add(a, b);

        // Assert
        Assert.AreEqual(8, result);
    }

    [TestMethod]
    public void Multiply_ShouldReturnCorrectProduct_WhenGivenTwoIntegers()
    {
        // Arrange
        var calculator = new Calculator();
        int a = 4, b = 7;

        // Act
        int result = calculator.Multiply(a, b);

        // Assert
        Assert.AreEqual(28, result);
    }
}
```

Later, we decide to add a new method Subtract to the Calculator class:

```
public class Calculator
{
// ... existing methods ...

    public int Subtract(int a, int b)
    {
        return a - b;
    }
}
```

Even though we added new functionality, our existing unit tests for the Add and Multiply methods give us confidence that we haven't broken any existing functionality. We can also create a new unit test for the Subtract method to ensure it works as intended:

```
[TestClass]
public class CalculatorTests
{
    // ... other test methods ...

    [TestMethod]
    public void Subtract_ShouldReturnCorrectDifference_WhenGivenTwoIntegers()
    {
        // Arrange
        var calculator = new Calculator();
        int a = 9, b = 4;

        // Act
        int result = calculator.Subtract(a, b);

        // Assert
        Assert.AreEqual(5, result);
    }
}
```

By maintaining a comprehensive suite of unit tests, we can catch regressions, ensure the correctness of our codebase, and minimize the risk of introducing bugs when adding or modifying features. As we continue to develop our application, it's crucial to keep the following best practices in mind:

**Write tests for new functionality**: As you develop new features or modify existing ones, always write corresponding unit tests to cover the changes. This ensures that the new code works as expected and doesn't introduce any regressions.

**Keep tests focused and isolated**: A unit test should cover a single functionality or scenario. If a test is too broad, it becomes harder to pinpoint the source of a failure when it occurs.

**Keep test code clean and maintainable**: Just like your production code, your test code should be clean, well-organized, and easy to understand. This makes it easier for other team members to read, understand, and update your tests as needed.

**Run tests frequently**: Make sure to run the full suite of unit tests regularly, especially before merging any changes into the main branch. This helps catch issues early and ensures that the codebase remains stable and reliable.

**Implement continuous integration**: If possible, set up continuous integration (CI) to automatically run your unit tests whenever changes are pushed to the repository. This helps maintain a high-quality codebase and provides instant feedback on the impact of new code.



By following these best practices and maintaining a robust suite of unit tests, you'll be well-equipped to develop a reliable and maintainable application. Remember that unit testing is an essential part of a healthy software development process, and investing time and effort into writing and maintaining tests will pay off in the long run.
